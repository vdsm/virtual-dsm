## Usage

Via `docker-compose.yml`

      - NET_ADMIN
    ports:
      - 5000:5000

```

## FAQ

  * ### How do I change the size of the virtual disk?

    To expand the default size of 16 GB, locate the `DISK_SIZE` setting in your compose file and modify it to your preferred capacity:

    ```yaml
    environment:
      DISK_SIZE: "128G"
    ```
    
    This can also be used to resize the existing disk to a larger capacity without any data loss. 

  * ### How do I change the location of the virtual disk?

    To change the virtual disk's location from the default Docker volume, include the following bind mount in your compose file:

    ```yaml
    volumes:
      - /home/user/data:/storage
    ```

    Replace the example path `/home/user/data` with the desired storage folder.

  * ### How do I add multiple disks?

    To create additional disks, modify your compose file like this:
    
    ```yaml
    environment:
      DISK2_SIZE: "32G"
      DISK3_SIZE: "64G"
    volumes:
      - /home/example:/storage2
      - /mnt/data/example:/storage3
    ```

  * ### How do I change the space reserved by the virtual disk? 

    By default, the entire disk space is reserved in advance. To create a growable disk that only reserves the space that is actually used, add the following environment variable:

    ```yaml
    environment:
      ALLOCATE: "N"
    ```

    Keep in mind that this will not affect any of your existing disks, it only applies to newly created disks.

  * ### How do I increase the amount of CPU or RAM?

    By default, a single core and 1 GB of RAM are allocated to the container. To increase this, add the following environment variables:

    ```yaml
    environment:
      RAM_SIZE: "4G"
      CPU_CORES: "4"
    ```

  * ### How do I verify if my system supports KVM?

    To verify if your system supports KVM, run the following commands:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install cpu-checker
    sudo kvm-ok
    ```

    If you receive an error from `kvm-ok` indicating that KVM acceleration can't be used, check your BIOS settings.

  * ### How do I assign an individual IP address to the container?

    By default, the container uses bridge networking, which shares the IP address with the host. 

    If you want to assign an individual IP address to the container, you can create a macvlan network as follows:

    ```bash
    docker network create -d macvlan \
        --subnet=192.168.0.0/24 \
        --gateway=192.168.0.1 \
        --ip-range=192.168.0.100/28 \
        -o parent=eth0 vdsm
    ```
    
    Be sure to modify these values to match your local subnet. 

    Once you have created the network, change your compose file to look as follows:

    ```yaml
    services:
      dsm:
        container_name: dsm
        ..<snip>..
        networks:
          vdsm:
            ipv4_address: 192.168.0.100

    networks:
      vdsm:
        external: true
    ```
   
    An added benefit of this approach is that you won't have to perform any port mapping anymore since all ports will be exposed by default.

    Please note that this IP address won't be accessible from the Docker host due to the design of macvlan, which doesn't permit communication between the two. If this is a concern, you need to create a [second macvlan](https://blog.oddbit.com/post/2018-03-12-using-docker-macvlan-networks/#host-access) as a workaround.

  * ### How can the container acquire an IP address from my router?

    After configuring the container for macvlan (see above), it is possible for DSM to become part of your home network by requesting an IP from your router, just like your other devices.

    To enable this feature, add the following lines to your compose file:

    ```yaml
    environment:
      DHCP: "Y"
    devices:
      - /dev/vhost-net
    device_cgroup_rules:
      - 'c *:* rwm'
    ```

    Please note that even if you don't need DHCP, it's still recommended to enable this feature as it prevents NAT issues and increases performance by using a `macvtap` interface.

  * ### How do I passthrough the GPU?

    To passthrough your Intel GPU, add the following lines to your compose file:

    ```yaml
    environment:
      GPU: "Y"
    devices:
      - /dev/dri
    ```

    This can be used to enable the facial recognition function in Synology Photos for example.

  * ### How do I install a specific version of vDSM?

    By default, version 7.2.1 will be installed, but if you prefer an older version, you can add its download URL to your compose file as follows:

    ```yaml
    environment:
      URL: "https://global.synologydownload.com/download/DSM/release/7.0.1/42218/DSM_VirtualDSM_42218.pat"
    ```

    With this method, it is even possible to switch between different versions while keeping all your file data intact.

  * ### What are the differences compared to the standard DSM?

    There are only two minor differences: the Virtual Machine Manager package is not available, and Surveillance Station will not include any free licenses.
    
  * ### Is this project legal?

    Yes, this project contains only open-source code and does not distribute any copyrighted material. Neither does it try to circumvent any copyright protection measures. So under all applicable laws, this project would be considered legal. 
    
    However, by installing Synology's Virtual DSM, you must accept their end-user license agreement, which does not permit installation on non-Synology hardware. So only run this project on an official Synology NAS, as any other use will be a violation of their terms and conditions.
